        <h3>Meat and Fish</h3>
        <p>
          Tribes rely on locally sourced pork, beef, chicken, and river fish. Meats are often smoked, spiced, and cooked with wild herbs. Meals are hearty and nourishing, reflecting the region’s natural bounty. One of the most common practices is smoking meat and fish, a method that not only enhances the flavor with a rich, earthy taste but also preserves the food for longer periods in the humid climate. Herbs and spices, often foraged from the forests, are used to season these dishes, giving them a unique aromatic profile that distinguishes Arunachali food from mainstream Indian cuisines.

        <h3>Rice Beer</h3>
        <p>
          Known locally as <b>Apong</b>, <b>rice beer</b> is a homemade beverage central to social life. It’s brewed for festivals and gatherings and served in bamboo mugs. The preparation uses boiled rice fermented in earthen pots, giving a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The brewing process itself reflects the intimate connection between the people and their environment. Boiled rice, often sourced from local fields, is fermented with natural yeast and herbs in earthen pots, a method passed down through generations. This age-old technique not only produces a mildly intoxicating drink with a sweet, earthy flavor but also preserves indigenous knowledge of fermentation and food science.
