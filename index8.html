      <h2>Pangsau Pass</h2>
      <p>Pangsau Pass is a historic mountain pass located on the Indo-Myanmar border, in the Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Sitting at about 3,727 feet above sea level, it connects India with Myanmar and holds great cultural, strategic, and historical importance.</p> <p>The pass is famously linked to the World War II-era Stilwell Road, which was built to connect Ledo (in Assam) to Kunming (in China) through Myanmar, serving as a vital supply route for Allied forces.</p> <p>The region is surrounded by thick forests, rolling hills, and misty landscapes, giving it a mysterious and adventurous appeal. Locally, it is also called the "Hell Pass" because during the war, soldiers and workers faced extreme difficulties here due to the harsh terrain and dense jungles. Today, Pangsau Pass is not only a trade and cultural link between India and Myanmar but also a tourist attraction, especially during the Pangsau Pass Winter Festival, where people from both sides of the border come together to celebrate their shared traditions, crafts, and music.</p>

      <h2>Zemithang</h2>
      <p>Zemithang is a hidden gem tucked away in the northwestern part of Arunachal Pradesh, lying close to the Indo-China border in the Tawang district. The valley sits at an elevation of about 7,000 feet above sea level and is surrounded by snow-capped Himalayan peaks, dense forests of pine and rhododendron, and sparkling rivers that give the entire area a pristine, untouched charm. The region is predominantly inhabited by the Monpa tribe, who are known for their warm hospitality, traditional stone-and-wood houses, and deep connection with Tibetan Buddhism. Life here is slow-paced and rooted in age-old customs, making Zemithang a living example of harmony between humans and nature. One of the most remarkable landmarks of Zemithang is the Gorsam Chorten, the largest Buddhist stupa in Arunachal Pradesh. Built in the 12th century, it stands at about 100 feet in height and is believed to be modeled after the world-famous Boudhanath Stupa in Nepal. The stupa is an important pilgrimage site for Buddhists and draws monks and devotees from across the Himalayan region during special ceremonies and festivals.</p>
